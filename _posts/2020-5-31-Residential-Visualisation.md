In April-May 2020 I undertook a internship at a small Architecture firm in Melbourne. The internship was undertaken for credit for my undergraduate degree, and was one of my final subjects before graduating. I was placed at a very small (as in, 2 employees small) lcoal practice and was excited to gain exposure to the architectural industry for the first time in a workplace setting. As the pandemic started to unfold in Melbourne, I unfortuntely ended up spending the majority of my  internship experience working remotely from home. The key project I was tasked with during this time was producing a set of architectural visualisations of a social housing proposal. Having just comlpeted a digital rendering subject a few months prior, I was initally keen to flex my 3DS Max + VRay skills, and was happy to be able to contribute to something worthwhile to the practice. 
<br><br>
The renders were to be presented to the client of the building project, as well as used in promoting the firms capabilites and experience in social housing typologies. <br>

As the architecture market swiftly changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the firm's director identified this area as being the most valuable and potentially lucrative focus for small firms.   
<br><br>

This was my first experience in producing rendered visualisations for a client/wider audience in a professional setting. Working towards (and sometimes against) the preferences and creative visions of others was something I was not used to, and posed several unexpected challenges that I learnt to reconcile. The experience made me realise just how much I hate 3DS Max and VRay, for how unstable, unreliable, outdated, clunky and uncompatiable it is with a modern design workflow. It was distressing how much I struggled with producing work, and how long it took me - for I really *wanted* to enjoy what I was doing, and wanted to produce something I was proud of. It was difficult to also manage the expectations of a emlpoyer figure, who didn't know anything about rendering or visualisation beyond Revit renders, who I acknowledged was growing somewhat frustrated at how long the tasks were taking me. 

<br><br>

This experience made me reflect on the fact that, as much as I love visualisation, there is no way I can progress any further in this area while still using 3DS Max. There has to be a better way.

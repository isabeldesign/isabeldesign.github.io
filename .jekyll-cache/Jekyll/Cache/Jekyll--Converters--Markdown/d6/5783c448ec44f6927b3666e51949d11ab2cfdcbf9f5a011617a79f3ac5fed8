  In July 2019, I had the pleasure of participating in New Paper II (Digital Knitting Unit) - the Melbourne AA Visiting School program run at the University of Melbourne. The experience profoundly impacted me as a student, and revolutionised my views on what I understood ~Architecture~ and ~Design~ to be, and where it could take me. Most importantly, I discovered during the course of this program that there is a place for people like me in the dicipline, and there are other people like me out there too.

  'The Pantosphere' was a group project, and an outcome of a wider unit discussion/contention on extremely abstract concepts and theories about 'the individual', 'utopia', ways of gathering and expressing ideas (not just in terms of representation). The Pantosphere is a Pantopian Digipelago - one island that represents a concept within our units proposed reality of a 'Pantopia'. This project materialised as several VR experiences, of which the Pantosphere is one.

<p class="project-subheading">What is the pantosphere?<br /></p>
<div class="project-paragraph">
    The Pantosphere's form is an inverted sphere. The surface is comprised of static artefacts of the old epoch, the Anthropocene, and the new epochs artfacts; the rapid accumulation of digital data build up.
    
    The Pantoscene is a digital epoch that is volitile and unpredictable between an instant to a second. Every click and scroll and end history browsing data is accumulating and forming a new geological layer.

            When we are sleeping, our digital persona synchronously obtains and distributes personal fragments of ourselves and others. We‚Äôre helpless to stop it. The Pantosphere spacializes the blind forfeiture of our intimate selves to artificial intelligence. Website cookies, IP footprints, retargeting tactics, and the statistical self, exposes our personal vulnerability to an artificial omniscient.
            
            The aesthetic qualities of the Pantosphere are insprired by popular instagram visual artists such as <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/klarens/?hl=en">@klarenns</a>. The vibrancy of colour and selective lighting highlights the stark, staticness of the old artfact of a previous era.

<div class="project-paragraph">
    The pantosphere base "OG" surface is a mere 200m radius primitive sphere component that was baked and re-referenced into grasshopper . The "references" were about 60 totum threads categorised into groups of 3 (short, medium and long threads). The three categories of threads were baked into individual 'slices' at varying offset lengths (75, 100, 150), to create variation in thread extrusion distances without distorting the threads and their objects. 
    <br /><br />
    In batches, I referenced in these threads, randomised them, and used text tags quickly check that all threads had been referenced, and enough 'randomness' was generated. Without jittering the list of threads, deliberate looking patterns were arising in the slices. Initially the idea was to then randomise the different threads of different heights, however it was decided that the accidental 'portal' like effect created by the longest threads was desirable and dynamic.

            This is not the most complex script I have ever written, but it is one I was able to quickly develop and implement successfully. It is written to minimise the risk of the software crashing and enables a swift, iterative work-flow. With our Grasshopper base model, we went on to use Unreal Engine to construct the Pantosphere and add materials, lighting, and binary code layers, as well as enact a storyboarded experience for the user.

<p class="project-subheading">Experience the Pantosphere<br /></p>
<div class="project-paragraph">
    
    The Pantosphere is not meant to feel welcoming and warm but rather hostile, scary and claustrophobic with a impending sense of doom. The user is to experience a world of wonder, that they can only view through spotlights.
    <br /> <br />
    They are otherwise in the dark and must frantically look around to open their field of vision. Glitchy, techy, unnatural sounds surround you. The static artefacts seem to be moving, the sphere as a whole is seemingly spinning on an axis - orbiting. 
    <br /> <br />
    Numbers unnaturally build up, appearing and disappearing, unpredictable? Or following the movement and vision of the user? It appears to be amassing weight each time. But before you an fixate yourself on a artefact as a visual depth cue, you notice that they seem to be closing in on you - at the centre.
    <br /> <br />
    The longest threads hit you first - they go through you and impale you but somehow you escape into the artefacts; you are propelled into the anthropocene layers to the outside of the sphere. 
    <br /> <br />
    It pauses - ...what the?... but now, you hurtle towards the sphere one again, burst through the layers and you gaze upon a portal of artefacts. The sphere grows, or you shrink, and the Pantosphere remains ever-changing, somehow unreachable and unsettling.

    <br />
    I've always struggling with understanding what it is that I like to do in design, and what kind of design work I want to be involved in the future. At the very least I have only known that I feel passionate about some ‚Äòthing‚Äô other than a traditional architecture practice. 
    <br /><br />
 

Initially, I came into the Digital Knitting unit feeling skeptical. Unlike other units we were not workshopping specific software and technical skills, nor did we have a solid brief and outcome in mind. What were we doing? What was the point of this? The idea of the Pantope and Pantopia seemed at first strange and I struggled to allow myself to get into the mindset where I could just ‚Äòroll with it‚Äô. It has been so engrained into me in most studios to ground all my work, theory and ideas in digestible and communicable spaces that are clearly architectural, and I was struggling to do this with such, imaginary(?) ideas. In regular studios I always feel as though im battling to come ot the 'correct' understanding or interpretation of something (ie a brief, my tutors personal prefrences, etc). But I think once I embraced that approach of just thinking about truly speculative ideas, as long as you can back it up, what we were doing started to make more sense and paradoxically my individual and our collective work felt loftier.

‚Äã

After AAVS, I feel enlightened and liberated as a designer. I feel immensely fulfilled with the work I produced, the friends I made, and the maturation of myself as a architecturally trained design-person [placeholder title until I figure out more stuff].

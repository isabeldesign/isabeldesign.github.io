            The interfaces at entry to the mothership, and within it, feel like an extension of the digital and virtual worlds of the future that citizens experience the world through. The mothership is designed to allow users agency to move in and out of this world at their leisure. 

            <br /><br />

            The signature component of the Mothership is the pod shuttle system as primary circulation. In 2119, AI driven pod travel is the most efficient wayfinding strategy, where clients are identified, checked in, and transported directly to the concourse lounge or their health practitioners office.

            Exploiting the Machine
            <br /><br />
            Upon arrival, your car is robotically vallet parked, in a secure location. A robot attendant greets you, confirms your arrival and checks you in for your booking. They will call for a shuttle pod to deliver you whever you need to be in the Mothership. Drones will deliver any pharmacuticals or equipment produced in the fab lab to your home by the time you arrive back.

            But a human in the showroom will walk you through a trial of the full body scanner, and will ensure you are comfortable and understand what is going on. A human will sit with you take your blood and talk through what the results mean for you. It will be a human reassuring your child that they're being so brave.

            The Mothership healthcare experience emphasizes early prediction and prevention, as well as ease of diagnosis and monitoring. It boasts 30 consult rooms of 5 varieties: room Type A for Physicians is the largest and includes most comprehensive suite of service bays.
            <br /><br />
            The layout of a Type A consult room is separated into two distinct zones: sterile and comfort. Clients enter the consult room via Pod and are greeting by their practitioner. They briefly stand on the body scanner where dozens of tests and exams are run, sit or stand for a quick pin-prick blood test, before proceeding either to the exam table or visualisation lounge to discuss their real time results.

            Structure

            The Mothershipâ€™s structural system looks to the future, and conforms to an efficient, rigid, mirrored grid. It implements a system similar to the Bone Steel Structure System developed in California.

            <br /><br />
            Members have â€˜smart highwaysâ€™ - pre-cut openings in various elements of the structure are ready to accommodate electricity, ventilation and heating. these highways provide easy routing while simplifying installation work and maintenance.

    This project representsÂ the culmination of my undergraduate study, representing my journey to where I am today as a student. That journey is defined by finding, and then following my passions and the things that are important to me as a designer.

    I faced extraneousÂ hurdles and push back from those who disagreed with my desicion to challenge the original brief, but I am proud that I stood my ground and stayed true to myself as a designer. The MothershipÂ was an unexpected battle - even in my final presentation I had to agressively assert the right to bother with speculative designs such as this, and justify the validity of my project.Â Staying true to myself as a designer while up against those who disagreed with my approaches and conventions, was tough.Â

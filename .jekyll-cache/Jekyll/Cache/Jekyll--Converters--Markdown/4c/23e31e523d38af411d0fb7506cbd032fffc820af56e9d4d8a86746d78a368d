In April-May 2020 I undertook a internship at a small Architecture firm in Melbourne. The internship was undertaken for credit for my undergraduate degree, and was one of my final subjects before graduating. I was placed at a very small (as in, 2 employees small) lcoal practice and was excited to gain exposure to the architectural industry for the first time in a workplace setting. As the pandemic started to unfold in Melbourne, I unfortuntely ended up spending the majority of my  internship experience working remotely from home. The key project I was tasked with during this time was producing a set of architectural visualisations of a social housing proposal. Having just comlpeted a digital rendering subject a few months prior, I was initally keen to flex my 3DS Max + VRay skills, and was happy to be able to contribute to something worthwhile to the practice. 
<br /><br />
The renders were to be presented to the client of the building project, as well as used in promoting the firms capabilites and experience in social housing typologies. <br />

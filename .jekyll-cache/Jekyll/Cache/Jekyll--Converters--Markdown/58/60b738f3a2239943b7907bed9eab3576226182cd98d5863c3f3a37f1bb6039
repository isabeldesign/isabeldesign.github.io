            ‘Money ’ depicts the lived-in space of an older, accomplished artistic, couple. The film continuously contrasts objects and elements of gaudy opulence, and elderly frailness. The song underpinning the film, Money, from Pink Floyd’s legendary album, Dark Side of the Moon [1973], creates an atmosphere of rock n roll spirit, which serves to further contradict both the tasteless neoclassical setting and geriatric artifacts littered throuhgout the film.

            This project was the end product of a subject that introduced students to design visualisation as a means of representation and story telling through architecture.

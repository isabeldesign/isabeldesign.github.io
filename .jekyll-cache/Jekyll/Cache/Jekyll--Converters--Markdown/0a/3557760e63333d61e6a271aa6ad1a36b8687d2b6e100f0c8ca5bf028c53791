In April/May 2020 I undertook a internship at a small Architecture firm in Melbourne. I was tasked with producing a set of architectural visualisations of a social housing proposal. The renders were to be presented to the client of the building project, as well as used in promoting the firms capabilites and experience in social housing typologies. As market swiftly changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the firm's director identified this area as being the most valuable and potentially lucrative focus for small firms.

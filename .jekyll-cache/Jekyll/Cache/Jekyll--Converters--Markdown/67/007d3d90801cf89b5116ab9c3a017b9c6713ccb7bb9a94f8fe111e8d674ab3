    â€˜Money â€™ depicts the lived-in space of an older, accomplished artistic, couple. The film continuously contrasts objects and elements of gaudy opulence, and elderly frailness. The song underpinning the film, Money, from Pink Floydâ€™s legendary album, <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW-lXjOyUWo&amp;list=PL3PhWT10BW3Urh8ZXXpuU9h526ChwgWKy">Dark Side of the Moon [1973]</a>, creates an atmosphere of rock n roll spirit, which serves to further contradict both the tasteless neoclassical setting and geriatric artifacts littered throuhgout the film.

            This project was the end product of a subject that introduced students to design visualisation as a means of representation and story telling through architecture.
            <br /><br />
            The 90 second film rendered at FHD/1080p, and A1 poster were created using 3DS Max and VRay; from storyboard to premiere in just 5 weeks, along side my capstone project.

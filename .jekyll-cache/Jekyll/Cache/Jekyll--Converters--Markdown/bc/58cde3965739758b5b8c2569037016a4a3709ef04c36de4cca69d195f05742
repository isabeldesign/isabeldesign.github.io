<p>Luck would have it that when I decided that it was time to explore new visualisation/rendering horizons, youtube user BlenderGuru began uploading a updated 2020 version of his iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U" class=" link">â€˜Blender Donutâ€™ series</a>. 
Blender 2.8 is a â€˜free and open source 3D creation suiteâ€™. BlenderGuru (Andrew) is a young Aussie CG enthusist, whose videos are well paced and thorough, and charmingly complemented by his commentary. Iâ€™d reccomend his series to anyone interested in learning Blender, starting from any level.</p>

<p>Blender has exploded in popularity in recent years amoung hobbiests, students and professionals alike. Blender sets itself apart from the antiquated, buggy and bloated ~conventional industry standard~ platforms such as Autodesk 3DS Max. After completing my recent set of social housing renders in 3Ds Max - I realised that I couldnâ€™t go on trying to wrangle technology that was just not up to scratch, and maintain any form of good mental health if I wanted to continue dabbling with CG.</p>

<p>In contrast to 3DS Max, it is wholly free, open source, and includes a proper in-built render engine (no $VRay or $Corona necessary), and has a mass following of enthusaistic and <em>young</em> CGI fanatics online and all over the world. It is on a trajectory to becoming the next big thing. The presence of a Blender community was alone enough to push me towards trialling the software. On Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/" class="link">r/blender</a> has the largest and most active community of all the CG/rendering software subreddit pages. The â€˜Blender Donutâ€™ series from BlenderGuru has become such a staple in the community, it has merited its own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlenderDoughnuts/" class="link">r/blenderdonuts</a> subreddit with 10k followers.</p>

<p>Young, and consistently updated, Blender is ahead of the curve, easy to use, and to this day has not crashed ONCE (putting it miles ahead of 3Ds Max).</p>

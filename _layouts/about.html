          My name is Isabel. I am a design student at the University of Melbourne. I have completed a Bachelor of Design where I majored in Architecture and recently commenced a Master of Architecture. 

          <br><br>
      
          At any given time, I am probably dabbling in something for fun (or compiling resources for when I have the spare time). I consistently aspire to learn new skills, techniques and ideas. 
          <br>
          My personal creative journey has been characterized by several key "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect" class="link">Eureka</a>" moments where I have been exposed to a new field, medium, or technique, and suddenly my path as a student and aspiring designer becomes clearer, or I derive new aspirations and inspiration that helps propel me forward to keep designing. 
          <!--<br><br>
          From a young age I've always been captivated by art and technology. As a child I wanted to be a "famous artist” when I grew up. As a teen with a Tumblr blog learning to use Photoshop, I dreamt of being a graphic designer. As a high school graduate discovering fabrication and 3D modelling, I knew I wanted to study architecture. -->
          <br><br>
          My design outcomes are often influenced by my personal passion and interests. I like to think that the more I learn and try, the richer and more interesting my work will become. I intend on writing about those passions in my <a href="/blog" class="link">blog</a>.

          This website was proudly built from scratch by yours truly. It is written in mainly HTML and CSS (a combo of Bootrap 4 and Vanilla CSS), with a bit of JavaScript (mostly JQuery) here and there. 
          <br><br>
          The site is hosted on GitHub pages, and uses a static site generator called Jekyll to help automate some processes.  
          <br><br>
          The skeleton of the site was build using a combination of CSS grid and Bootstrap Flexbox. 
          <br><br>
          All code was written in Visual Studio Code, and backed-up and version controlled using Git.
